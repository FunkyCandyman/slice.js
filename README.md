slice.js
========

a JavaScript library for encrypted file up- and downloads

This approach of writing a js library (:D) is currently under rewrite and has temporarily moved to [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/FunkyCandyman/embassy.js) until it's slightly usable.


License (see LICENSE):
This library is currently licensed under the terms of the "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported" license.
I plan to put this work under a free (OS) license when it's finished and I feel comfortable with the decision.
